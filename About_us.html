      <p>I’m Sylvia and I’m from 2024 class of UW. I love traveling, shopping and listening to musics. As an international student, I was nervous when I first came to the campus. Housing is one of the most important issue to think about. I hope this website can provide more and more students like me with real and useful information shared by others.</p>
