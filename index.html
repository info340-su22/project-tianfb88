    <h1>Topic Proposal: Legalize the Abortion</h1>

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
        On June 24, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade by allowing states to ban abortion. This act is criminalizing abortion and disempowering female to make their own decision of their bodies and healthcare. According to CDC 2017, there was 11.2 abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing age, and the number is rising. Millions of people across the nation will be impacted either directly or indirectly by the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court on their rights of reproductive, health, lives & financial stability. After the news of illigalization of abortion, hundreds of petition to mantain Roe v. Wade appeared on Change.org. However, abortion is a sensitive topic and far from most people’s daily lives. To raise public awareness of abortion and advocate legalizing abortion, we decided to build a web page. We will be analyzing abortion data from the U.S. database 
        (<a href="https://data.gov/">data.gov</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            The general topic that we are interested in is the abortion-related issue in the United States because it has been a controversial problem in recent days. Our main goal is to provide people with more detailed information about abortion by analyzing and visualizing the datasets. With the help of the information provided by our web app, people can have a better understanding on this topic and have a more objective view on it when discussing the specific issue of abortion.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>
            The ‘main-audience’ users for this application are women, women who are looking for the information about abortion and reproductive health in particular. However, besides women, people who care about the abortion rights, who want to know more about abortion, who have no idea about what is going on for abortion right demonstrations that happen in everywhere recently, and who have their own statement or have not yet about abortion rights. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We would like to use a bundle of csv files that are published by California Department of Health Care Services. 
            (<a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/abortion-related-services-funded-by-medi-cal-calendar-years-2014-2020-05ff4">link for dataset source</a>). Therefore, we want our users to make our application as a source for getting information by sorting, filtering, and other operations to the dataset for having the clear data visualizations and comparison about the abortion related services. Also, we want to include the updates and news about the abortion rights. What is more, we plan to include articles and blogs that are related to reproductive health and abortion services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our solution is a data exploration web application that allows users to filter and sortthe abortion-related service dataset about specific county in California, the healthcare delivery system provide the service, the expenditures of the service, age group, and race or ethnicity. User also can choose their desired data column to visualize the data, and download our cleaned dataset if they want.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using our app, users will be able to easily visualize the healthcare agencies that provide abortion-related service and fees of their service between 2014-2020, which can help women access the available abortion service in California. Moreover, by visualizing abortions by age group and race, we can find the needs of abortion and its trends related to different cultural background and age group.
