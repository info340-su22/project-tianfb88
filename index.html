        <p>
            The main topic that our group is interested in is the rating platform of housing around UW. For most of the students at UW, how to find decent housing is one of the most important problems to think about. However, since UW is an international university with students from all over the world, many students are not familiar with the apartments nearby. So our group wants to create a platform that is open to all the students at UW to collect information about different housing options around UW. When more and more information is gathered, students can have a better understanding about different housing options and find their satisfactory place to leave with the help of our website.
