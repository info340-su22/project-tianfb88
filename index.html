    <h1>Topic Proposal: Legalize the Abortion</h1>

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
        On June 24, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade by allowing states to ban abortion. This act is criminalizing abortion and disempowering female to make their own decision of their bodies and healthcare. According to CDC 2017, there was 11.2 abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing age, and the number is rising. Millions of people across the nation will be impacted either directly or indirectly by the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court on their rights of reproductive, health, lives & financial stability. After the news of illigalization of abortion, hundreds of petition to mantain Roe v. Wade appeared on Change.org. However, abortion is a sensitive topic and far from most people’s daily lives. To raise public awareness of abortion and advocate legalizing abortion, we decided to build a web page. We will be analyzing abortion data from the U.S. database 
        (<a href="https://data.gov/">data.gov</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            The general topic that we are interested in is the abortion-related issue in the United States because it has been a controversial problem in recent days. Our main goal is to provide people with more detailed information about abortion by analyzing and visualizing the datasets. With the help of the information provided by our web app, people can have a better understanding on this topic and have a more objective view on it when discussing the specific issue of abortion.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>
            The ‘main-audience’ users for this application are women, women who are looking for the information about abortion and reproductive health in particular. However, besides women, people who care about the abortion rights, who want to know more about abortion, who have no idea about what is going on for abortion right demonstrations that happen in everywhere recently, and who have their own statement or have not yet about abortion rights. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We would like to use a bundle of csv files that are published by California Department of Health Care Services. 
            (<a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/abortion-related-services-funded-by-medi-cal-calendar-years-2014-2020-05ff4">link for dataset source</a>). Therefore, we want our users to make our application as a source for getting information by sorting, filtering, and other operations to the dataset for having the clear data visualizations and comparison about the abortion related services. Also, we want to include the updates and news about the abortion rights. What is more, we plan to include articles and blogs that are related to reproductive health and abortion services.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three main interactive features in the application, including search, filtering and review. With the search feature, users can search for apartments by typing the keyword,  apartment name and zip code. Users can also filter their apartment options by distance to campus, rent range, and all types of  floor plans. After that, users will be able to see detailed information such as name, location, rent, amenities, construction dates etc. If users want to share their living experience with other peers, they can also submit their ratings and comments via our review page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our solution is a data exploration web application that allows users to search, filter and compare different apartments around the University District, and helps users navigate through their apartment search process efficiently. Users no longer  need to open many apartment websites and compare them by writing down some note manually, and they will be able to get all the organized and detailed information by just several clicks.
